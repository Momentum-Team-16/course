The past few months have prepared you to take on the challenge ahead in these next four weeks. You may not _feel_ ready, but you ARE.

At the end of this phase, your team will present your product to an audience of local tech professionals, hiring partners, and the Momentum community.

## âœ… TODO this morning

1. ðŸ•› BY NOON: [Make sure you have filled out this survey](https://forms.gle/8rFDYT9z3Q3BDEfF7) about your interests and intentions for Phase 4.

## âœ… TODO this afternoon

Team assignments will be made this afternoon. These TODOs are for after you have that information.

1. **Create a Slack channel** (please [create an actual channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201402297-Create-a-channel), not a thread) and add team members, Amy, and Rebecca to it.
2. **Create a team charter** with your team and pin or bookmark it in your team's Slack channel. This is an agreement you create together to determine the expectations you have for each other and ensure you can met your goals. Use your experience working on teams in the past to figure out what will help you work together with a minimum of friction and a maximum of productivity. [Here are references][team-charter] to help you with creating this agreement.
3. Brainstorm ideas for your final project with your team, and **be ready to pitch one or two ideas tomorrow morning**.
