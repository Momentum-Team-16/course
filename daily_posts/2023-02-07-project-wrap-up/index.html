<p>üëâ If your project meets minimum requirements today, HUZZAH! That is awesome. You should be working on <strong>at least one additional or spicy feature</strong>.</p>

<p>üëâ If your project does not yet meet minimum requirements, your goal should be meeting them <strong>by the end of the day tomorrow</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Please include a README</strong> in your project repo. The README should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be titled README.md and live at the root of your project repo</li>
  <li>be written in Markdown</li>
  <li>include a link to your production application</li>
  <li>have instructions for getting your application running locally, so that any developer could pull it down and run it</li>
  <li>Backend: your README must include documentation for your API‚Äôs available endpoints</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A user is able to sign up/register to be a user of your app.</li>
  <li>A user is able to log in to the app, and log out.</li>
  <li>A user can see a list of all the cards from all users of the app.</li>
  <li>A user can see a list of all the cards they‚Äôve created.</li>
  <li>A user can see the details of a single card (with front and back messages).</li>
  <li>A user can create a new card.</li>
  <li>A user can update a card they created.</li>
  <li>A user can delete a card they created.</li>
  <li>A user can follow another user.</li>
  <li>A user can unfollow another user.</li>
  <li>A user can see a list all cards created by a user that they follow.</li>
  <li>A user can see a list all the users they follow.</li>
  <li>Your repo includes a README with project documentation.</li>

</ul>

<p>Depending on how you‚Äôve constructed your API, you might have separate endpoints for all of the above, or some of the functionality might be combined in a single endpoint (for instance, if you nested answers in the question detail endpoint, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">questions/4/answers</code>). What matters is that your front-end team can perform all the necessary actions to provide full functionality to the user and that your endpoints are accurately documented in your README.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Be sure to test that you have implemented permissions-checking correctly for these endpoints. For example, your API should not allow a user who is not the creator of a card to update a card.</p>
