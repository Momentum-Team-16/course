<p>Your team’s Trello board is ready with columns predefined to start you off. You are welcome to adapt it and create additional columns to support the way your team works.</p>

<p>You should put your user stories on your Trello board in the User Stories column. You’ll find a template card for user stories that you can copy if you want.</p>

<p>Then, break them down into tasks and put tasks on cards.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-make-cards">How to make cards</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Task cards go in the Backlog column.</li>
  <li>Use the Task Card template.</li>
  <li>One task per card</li>
  <li>Each task should be doable in a day or less.</li>
  <li>Don’t assign tasks to anyone yet.</li>
  <li>Link a task back to its user story card using the User Story field.</li>
  <li>Each card must include how you will know when the task is done (its “definition of done”).</li>
</ul>
