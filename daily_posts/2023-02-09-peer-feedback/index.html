  <div><p>Working on a software engineering team requires a great deal of skill, and not just on the technical side. The skills you need to collaborate successfully can be learned and practiced and can grow over time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qpJxEhOP4">This short video explains why a growth mindset in a professional context is valuable to employers and employees alike</a>.</p>

<p>The purposes of peer feedback include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to encourage folks to keep doing what is helpful and productive for the team</li>
  <li>to demonstrate how one’s actions affect others</li>
  <li>to highlight specific areas to practice and improve on in Phase 4 and beyond</li>
</ul>

<p>Honest feedback is valuable when offered respectfully and in the spirit of kindness and cooperation. Creating software is a team sport!</p>

<p>✅ <strong><a href="https://forms.gle/NYVyTHmxpX45o1pY6">Please fill out this form by tomorrow at noon</a></strong> for the people you are assigned to review. You’ll get a message from me in Slack letting you know who you should submit feedback for, but you are also welcome to submit feedback for anyone else I haven’t assigned.</p>
