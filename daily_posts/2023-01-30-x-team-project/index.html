  <div><p>This week you will begin work on a project with both front- and back-end teammates. This project is due at the end of the Phase, on Thursday, February  9.</p>

<p>In order to successfully complete the phase:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This project must be complete and meet the minimum requirements.</li>
  <li>It must be deployed and running without errors in production.</li>
  <li>Each team member must make a substantive contribution to the project (this is best demonstrated through frequent, well-formed commits).</li>
  <li>Each team member must be able to explain how the project works (that is, back-end devs know how the back-end works; front-end devs know how the front-end works).</li>
</ul>

<p>The front-end will build a React application that will make AJAX requests to the back-end application built with Django and Django REST Framework. There are no strict rules about who works on front-end or back-end, so your team can decide how best to use your resources.</p>

<p>Your team can choose between two projects. They will <em>both</em> give you practice doing what you have been doing (building an API or building a React application) but they present some different problems to solve.</p>

<p>Choose the one that sounds more fun or interesting to you.</p>

<p>We haven‚Äôt yet covered everything you‚Äôll need to be able to do this project, so that will be our task this week and next.</p>

<p>The back end will work in their own repo and the front end will work in their own repo, so for the same project there will be <em>two</em> repos.</p>

<p><strong>One back-end dev</strong> should accept the assignment invitation and create a new team; name the team something like ‚ÄúTeam Yeti Back-end‚Äù (whatever your team name is!). Then the other back-end dev(s) should accept the assignment and choose the right team. All back-end folks on the team clone that same repo.</p>

<p><strong>One front-end dev</strong> should accept the assignment invitation and create a new team; name the team something like ‚ÄúTeam Yeti Front-end‚Äù (whatever your team name is!). Then the other front-end dev(s) should accept the assignment and choose the right team. All front-end folks on the team clone that same repo.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è You have to accept the invitation and join the team your teammate created in order to have write permissions to the repo.</p>

<p><strong>Today you should not need to commit or push any code since your main goal is planning</strong>. Tomorrow you will learn how to work with others in a shared repo.</p>

<p>Even though you have separate codebases and separate applications, you‚Äôre working together to ship a single product, on time. You can make product decisions together even though you will implement features separately.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll check in on the projects in class; front and back end teams will continue to meet separately. Come to your front-end or back-end meeting prepared to give progress reports and ask for help on what you‚Äôre working on.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to work with the other front-end or back-end devs on other teams to share ideas, solutions, and resources.</p>

<h3 id="-your-goals-today-">ü•Ö Your Goals Today ü•Ö</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Read each project‚Äôs README.</li>
  <li>Decide which project you want to do.</li>
  <li>Read your project‚Äôs README again, carefully.</li>
  <li>Understand the project requirements thoroughly and discuss with your team what you need to build.</li>
  <li>Outline a detailed plan for how your team will implement the project requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>WRITE YOUR PLANS DOWN.</strong> You can use any tools you like as long as the content you create is shareable. Some tools that might be useful: Trello, Google Docs, Excalidraw, Miro. Make sure everyone on your team has access to this documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="front-end">Front-end</h4>

<p>You will need to sketch out the <strong><a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows">user flow</a></strong> and <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/wireframing/wireframe-design-101/">draw up some <strong>wireframes</strong></a> for the application. It can help to ask questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What does our user see when they first land on our site?</li>
  <li>What will they need to do here?</li>
  <li>How will they accomplish that?</li>
  <li>What will happen next?</li>
  <li>If they click on a button or link, what happens?</li>
  <li>What does the UI look like after the user clicks on something / follows a link / submits a form?</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="by-tomorrow-front-end-should-have">By tomorrow front-end should have</h5>

<ul>
  <li>A detailed user flow plan/diagram</li>
  <li>Detailed wireframes</li>
  <li>A good initial plan of the components you think you will need</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="back-end">Back-end</h4>

<p>You will need to draw ER diagrams to plan out the <strong>models</strong> and start a list of <strong>endpoints</strong> you think you will need. It can help to ask questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the <em>nouns</em> in your project requirements? These are likely models.</li>
  <li>What data will you need to save in your database so you can look it up again later?</li>
  <li>What information will the front-end need so they can accomplish the UI that they are planning?</li>
  <li>What permissions will need to be in place?</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="by-tomorrow-back-end-should-have">By tomorrow back-end should have</h5>

  <li>A good initial plan for the JSON you think you will need to return</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="git-workflow">Git Workflow</h3>

<p>Working with other developers in a shared codebase means that the workflow you‚Äôve been using so far will have to change. <strong>We will cover this together on Tuesday.</strong> If you want to get a head start, here are the slides for reference.</p>
